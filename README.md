The Fox is Black Wallpaper Downloader Project
================================

This used to be a fork but I decided to rewrite it in js since my python chops are stale. To run:

    npm install
    node download.js

The lovely folks over at [The Fox is Black](http://www.thefoxisblack.com/category/the-desktop-wallpaper-project) have been releasing a treasure trove of awesome desktop designs as a part of the Desktop Wallpaper Project. I found the webpage to be a little slow to load and there is unfortunately no way to download all backgrounds as a bundle. I wrote this little script to grab each background at the highest resolution available.
